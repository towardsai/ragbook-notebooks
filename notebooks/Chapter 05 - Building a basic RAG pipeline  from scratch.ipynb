        "\n",
        "Meta has introduced the Llama 4 model family, marking a significant advancement in open-weight multimodal AI with three distinct variants designed for different use cases. The Llama 4 Scout represents the more compact option with 17 billion active parameters utilizing 16 experts within a total parameter count of 109 billion, designed to fit on a single H100 GPU with Int4 quantization. The Llama 4 Maverick serves as the flagship model with 17 billion active parameters but employs 128 experts across 400 billion total parameters, fitting on a single H100 host and designed as the primary workhorse for general assistant and chat applications. The preview model Llama 4 Behemoth functions as a teacher model with 288 billion active parameters, 16 experts, and nearly 2 trillion total parameters, currently still in training but demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks.\n",
        "The architecture represents Meta's first implementation of mixture-of-experts (MoE) design in the Llama series, fundamentally changing how the models process information by activating only a fraction of total parameters for each token. The MoE architecture alternates between dense and mixture-of-experts layers, with the Maverick model specifically using 128 routed experts alongside a shared expert, where each token is processed by the shared expert and routed to one of the 128 specialized experts. This design significantly improves compute efficiency during both training and inference while delivering higher quality outputs compared to dense models with equivalent computational budgets.\n",
        "Native multimodality represents another breakthrough, achieved through early fusion architecture that seamlessly integrates text and vision tokens into a unified model backbone during pre-training. This approach enables joint training with massive amounts of unlabeled text, image, and video data, with the vision encoder based on MetaCLIP but trained separately in conjunction with a frozen Llama model to optimize adaptation to the language model. The models support up to 48 images during pre-training and demonstrate strong performance with up to 8 images in post-training scenarios, enabling sophisticated visual reasoning and understanding tasks across multiple input modalities.\n",
        "The training infrastructure incorporates several technical innovations, including the MetaP technique for reliable hyperparameter optimization that transfers well across different model configurations and training scenarios. The models were trained on over 30 trillion tokens, representing more than double the training data of Llama 3, with support for 200 languages including over 100 languages with more than 1 billion tokens each. Training efficiency was maximized through FP8 precision without quality sacrifice, achieving 390 TFLOPs per GPU utilization on 32,000 GPUs during Behemoth pre-training, while a specialized mid-training phase enhanced core capabilities and enabled the industry-leading 10 million token context length for Scout.\n",
        "Context length capabilities represent a dramatic advancement, with Llama 4 Scout supporting 10 million tokens compared to Llama 3's 128K limit through the innovative iRoPE architecture that employs interleaved attention layers without positional embeddings and inference-time temperature scaling of attention. This architecture enables superior length generalization and opens possibilities for multi-document summarization, extensive user activity parsing for personalization, and reasoning over vast codebases, with compelling performance demonstrated in retrieval tasks and cumulative negative log-likelihood evaluations over 10 million tokens of code.\n",
        "The post-training pipeline underwent significant revision with a three-stage approach consisting of lightweight supervised fine-tuning, online reinforcement learning, and lightweight direct preference optimization. A critical insight involved removing over 50% of data tagged as easy using Llama models as judges, focusing training on harder examples to prevent over-constraining that could restrict exploration during online RL and lead to suboptimal performance in reasoning, coding, and mathematics. The continuous online RL strategy alternated between model training and adaptive data filtering to retain only medium-to-hard difficulty prompts, proving highly beneficial for compute and accuracy trade-offs.\n",
        "Safety and bias mitigation received comprehensive attention through multi-layered approaches spanning pre-training data filtering, post-training policy conformance, and system-level safeguards. Meta introduced Generative Offensive Agent Testing (GOAT) to address traditional red-teaming limitations by simulating multi-turn interactions of medium-skilled adversarial actors, enabling more efficient vulnerability detection while allowing human experts to focus on novel adversarial areas. Particular emphasis was placed on addressing political and social bias inherent in internet training data, with Llama 4 demonstrating significant improvements over Llama 3 in presenting balanced perspectives on contentious issues without favoring particular viewpoints.\n",
        "The distillation process for creating smaller models from Behemoth required novel approaches, including a dynamic loss function that weighted soft and hard targets throughout training, with codistillation during pre-training amortizing computational costs for the majority of training data. Post-training the 2 trillion parameter Behemoth model necessitated pruning 95% of supervised fine-tuning data compared to 50% for smaller models, followed by large-scale reinforcement learning focused on sampling hard prompts through pass@k analysis and constructing training curricula of increasing difficulty. The unprecedented scale required complete infrastructure overhaul, including optimized MoE parallelization and fully asynchronous online RL training framework that improved training efficiency by approximately 10x over previous generations through flexible GPU allocation and resource balancing across multiple models.\n",
