        "Progressive neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and the loss of retinal ganglion cells is a hallmark of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) being the most frequent form of glaucoma in the Western world. While some genetic mutations have been identified for some glaucomas, those associated with POAG are limited and for most POAG patients, the etiology is still unclear. Unfortunately, treatment of this neurodegenerative disease and other retinal degenerative diseases is lacking. For POAG, most of the treatments focus on reducing aqueous humor formation, enhancing uveoscleral or conventional outflow, or lowering intraocular pressure through surgical means. These efforts, in some cases, do not always lead to a prevention of vision loss and therefore other strategies are needed to reduce or reverse the progressive neurodegeneration. In this review, we will highlight some of the ocular pharmacological approaches that are being tested to reduce neurodegeneration and provide some form of neuroprotection.\n",

        "To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.\n",

At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/CCl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable. The optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight.
